Wallet Address: 0xff4252ac4c03ca90ec223f451f2434a5bfa8ec69

--- Final Result ---
Classification: Uncertain
Confidence Level: Low
Key Indicators:
- Transaction Frequency Patterns: Only 6 transactions over 253 days, with some clustering around specific days.
- Fee Expenditure Patterns: Transaction fees are low and consistent, suggesting possible optimization.
- Activity Consistency: Sparse activity with long gaps between transactions.
- Time Patterns of Transactions: No clear pattern related to typical human activity hours.
Analysis: The transaction history is too sparse to confidently classify the wallet as operated by a bot or a human. The low number of transactions and lack of clear patterns in timing or fee expenditure make it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.
