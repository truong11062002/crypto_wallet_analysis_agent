Wallet Address: 0x48a206ffbd8b0bfde9f59a7f7a6668ae9f04de84

--- Final Result ---
Classification: Uncertain
Confidence Level: Medium

Key Indicators:
- **Supporting Bot Classification:**
  - Transactions are frequent and occur at various times, including non-typical human hours, suggesting automated activity.
  - Consistent use of similar gas fees, indicating possible automated settings.
  - Transactions involve multiple smart contracts and token interactions, which can be indicative of automated trading or DeFi activities.

- **Supporting Human Classification:**
  - Some transactions are spaced out and involve varied amounts, which could suggest manual intervention.
  - The presence of NFT interactions might indicate personal interest rather than purely automated trading.

Analysis: The transaction history shows a mix of patterns that could suggest both automated and manual activities. The frequency and timing of transactions lean towards automation, but the diversity in transaction types and amounts, along with NFT interactions, suggest possible human involvement. Without more specific behavioral patterns or external context, the classification remains uncertain.
