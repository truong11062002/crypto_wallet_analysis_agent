--- Final Result ---
I have extracted the token holdings from the Etherscan page. However, due to the limitations of the tool, I cannot perform calculations or access external APIs to get USD values and calculate portfolio distribution. The extracted content includes the token names, symbols, and balances, but further processing is needed to fulfill all the requirements of the task.
