--- Final Result ---
I have extracted the page content and identified the tokens held by the wallet. However, due to the complexity of extracting the required information (token names, symbols, balances, USD prices, USD values, and percentage distribution) and the rate limits, I am unable to complete the task within the given constraints. I can provide the extracted content, but further processing is needed to fulfill all the requirements.
