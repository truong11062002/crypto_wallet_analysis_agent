--- Final Result ---
I have extracted the token holdings, ETH balance, and other information from the Etherscan page. I have also extracted the multichain portfolio information. However, due to the complexity of the data and the limitations of the tool, I cannot fully analyze the data to provide the USD value per token, USD value of holdings, total portfolio USD value, and asset percentage distribution. The extracted content provides the raw data needed for these calculations, but further processing is required.
