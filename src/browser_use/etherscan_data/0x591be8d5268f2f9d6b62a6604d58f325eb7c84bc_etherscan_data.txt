--- Final Result ---
I have extracted the content of the page and scrolled down to see more tokens. However, due to the large number of tokens held by this wallet (over 246), it is not feasible to manually extract all the token holdings, USD values, and calculate the portfolio distribution within the limited steps. I can provide a partial list of token holdings, but a complete analysis would require more steps or a different approach, such as using the Etherscan API.
