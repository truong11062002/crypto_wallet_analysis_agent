Wallet Address: 0x5ddad02fb1e60b83b4acf7cc5beb104e4392df20

--- Final Result ---
I have extracted the token holdings from the Etherscan page. However, due to the limitations of the tool, I cannot automatically calculate the USD value per token, the USD value of holdings, the total portfolio USD value, and the asset percentage distribution. I have extracted the names, symbols, and balances of the tokens held by the wallet. The user will need to manually calculate the remaining information.
