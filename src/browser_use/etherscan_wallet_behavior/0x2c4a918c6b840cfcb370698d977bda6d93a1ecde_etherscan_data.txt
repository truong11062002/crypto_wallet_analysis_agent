Wallet Address: 0x2c4a918c6b840cfcb370698d977bda6d93a1ecde

--- Final Result ---
Classification: Uncertain
Confidence Level: Medium
Key Indicators:
- **Supporting Factors for Bot Classification:**
  - Transactions are frequent and occur at various times, including late night and early morning hours, suggesting automated activity.
  - Consistent use of small transaction amounts and similar gas fees, indicating a possible automated strategy.
- **Supporting Factors for Human Classification:**
  - Some variability in transaction timing and amounts, which could suggest human intervention.
- **Contradicting Factors:**
  - Lack of clear clustering or bursts of transactions that are typical of bots reacting to market events.

Analysis: The transaction history shows a mix of characteristics that could indicate both automated and manual operation. The frequency and timing of transactions suggest automation, but the variability in amounts and lack of clear clustering around market events leave room for human operation. Therefore, the classification remains uncertain with medium confidence.
