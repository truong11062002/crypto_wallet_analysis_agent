Wallet Address: 0x14c90a5e3f0933dd21f84074e10ef4fe4f16e683

--- Final Result ---
Classification: Uncertain
Confidence Level: Medium
Key Indicators:
- Supporting Factors: 
  - Transactions are frequent and occur at various times, suggesting automated activity.
  - Consistent use of small transaction amounts and approvals, which may indicate bot-like behavior.
- Contradicting Factors:
  - Some variability in transaction timing and amounts, which could suggest human intervention.
Analysis: The transaction history shows frequent and small transactions, often associated with bot activity. However, the variability in timing and amounts introduces uncertainty, making it difficult to definitively classify the wallet as operated by a bot or human.
