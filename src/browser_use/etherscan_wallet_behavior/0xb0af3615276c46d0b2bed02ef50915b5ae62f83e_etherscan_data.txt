Wallet Address: 0xb0af3615276c46d0b2bed02ef50915b5ae62f83e

--- Final Result ---
Classification: Bot
Confidence Level: High
Key Indicators:
- Transactions are frequent and occur at all hours, suggesting automated activity.
- Consistent use of small transaction amounts and frequent approvals, typical of automated trading or bot activity.
- Gas fees are consistently low, indicating optimization for cost efficiency, a common trait in bot operations.
- Activity is consistent over time with no clear pattern related to human activity hours.
Contradicting Factors:
- None significant enough to suggest human operation.
Analysis: The transaction patterns, frequency, and gas fee optimization strongly indicate that this wallet is operated by a bot. The lack of correlation with typical human activity hours and the nature of transactions (frequent, small, and automated) support this conclusion.
