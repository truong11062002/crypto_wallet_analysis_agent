### Wallet Analysis for Address: 0xfe11490fcfd9940db0df0f1b3e6775669144f465

- **Average Transaction Size:** $152.47 (Classification: Small)

**Wallet Data Analysis for Address: 0xb0af3615276c46d0b2bed02ef50915b5ae62f83e**

- **Average Transaction Size**: $210.95 (Classification: Small)
- **Total 30-Day Volume**: $6,328.50 (20% of total wallet value)

1. **ETH**: 60% (Direction: Balanced)
2. **USDT**: 25% (Direction: Outgoing)
3. **USDC**: 15% (Direction: Incoming)

With the average transaction size categorized as small, this indicates frequent, lower-value transactions, typical of an active yet not large-scale individual user or small entity managing ordinary transactions.
