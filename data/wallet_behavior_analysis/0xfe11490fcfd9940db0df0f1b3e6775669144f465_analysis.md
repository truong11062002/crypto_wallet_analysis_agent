# Analysis for 0xfe11490fcfd9940db0df0f1b3e6775669144f465

Classification: Uncertain  
Confidence Level: Low

Key Indicators:
- **Transaction Frequency Patterns:** Only 4 transactions over a span of 1,254 days, which is very sparse and does not provide enough data to determine a pattern.
- **Response to Market Conditions:** No discernible pattern related to market conditions due to the low number of transactions.
- **Fee Expenditure Patterns:** Transaction fees vary slightly but are not enough to establish a pattern.
- **Activity Consistency:** Very low activity with long gaps between transactions.
- **Time Patterns of Transactions:** Transactions are spread out over a long period with no specific time pattern.

Analysis: The minimal number of transactions in the wallet over a prolonged period indicates sporadic use, making it challenging to attribute characteristics typically associated with either bots or human users. The lack of transaction frequency and identifiable patterns results in a low confidence level for classification.
