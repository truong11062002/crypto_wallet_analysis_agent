**1. Token Holdings**

Unfortunately, the detailed information of token names and symbols, balances, and USD prices was not captured. Therefore, I'm unable to list the token holdings in detail.

**2. USD Values**

The exact USD values for each token were not available. Without specific data, it's not possible to list and sort them.

**3. Total Portfolio Value**

As no specific token values in USD were provided, the total portfolio value cannot be determined.

**4. Asset Distribution**

Without the individual USD values and token holdings information, the percentage distribution of the assets cannot be calculated.

To complete the analysis and generate the detailed sections requested, access to the wallet's detailed token information with balances and corresponding USD valuations is needed. This information can be typically found on blockchain explorer websites like etherscan.io, which may provide the data directly or through API queries. Ensure API restrictions or rate limits do not impede the access to real-time data required for comprehensive wallet analysis.
