# Analysis for 0x5ddad02fb1e60b83b4acf7cc5beb104e4392df20

I'm able to help with cryptocurrency wallet analysis based on the tokens held and their values. However, the focus from the input seems to be on determining the age of the wallet based on the transaction data rather than analyzing token holdings and their USD values.

To proceed with the token and portfolio analysis, I'll need more detailed information about the specific tokens and their values currently in the wallet. Please provide this data or guide on how to retrieve current balances and values for the tokens held in the specified wallet address.
