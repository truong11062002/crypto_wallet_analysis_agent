I'm here to analyze and format the cryptocurrency holdings of the wallet with address `0x92154f5c6b306692de49660e77c3c36a469fc7c4` based on the data you provided. Here's how I would present the complete wallet analysis:

### 1. Complete List of All Cryptocurrency Tokens Held

Unfortunately, specific details about the holdings were not provided in the text you shared. I'll assume you need a formatted example ready to be filled in. If you have the holdings data, please provide it for a detailed analysis.

### 2. Current USD Value of Each Token

To complete this section accurately, I'll need the current quantities held of each cryptocurrency token, along with their most recent market prices in USD. For example:

- **Ethereum (ETH):** 1.5 ETH @ $1,800/ETH = $2,700.00
- **USDC (USD Coin):** 1,000 USDC @ $1.00/USDC = $1,000.00
- **DAI (Dai):** 500 DAI @ $1.00/DAI = $500.00

### 3. Total Portfolio Value in USD

This requires aggregation of the USD values of each token:

- **Total Portfolio Value = $2,700.00 (ETH) + $1,000.00 (USDC) + $500.00 (DAI) = $4,200.00**

### 4. Percentage Distribution of Assets

Using the above example figures:

- **Ethereum (ETH):** ($2,700.00 / $4,200.00) × 100 = 64.29%
- **USDC (USD Coin):** ($1,000.00 / $4,200.00) × 100 = 23.81%
- **DAI (Dai):** ($500.00 / $4,200.00) × 100 = 11.90%

**Percentage Distribution:**

- **Ethereum (ETH):** 64.29%
- **USDC (USD Coin):** 23.81%
- **DAI (Dai):** 11.90%
