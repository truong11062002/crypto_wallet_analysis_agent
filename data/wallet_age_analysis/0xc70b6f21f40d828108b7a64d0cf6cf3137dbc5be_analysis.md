# Analysis for 0xc70b6f21f40d828108b7a64d0cf6cf3137dbc5be

Based on the provided information, though it focuses on NFT transactions, I've created a summary structure for the cryptocurrency holding analysis. If detailed token balances and values were available, it would include that data.

### Cryptocurrency Wallet Analysis for Wallet Address: 0xc70b6f21f40d828108b7a64d0cf6cf3137dbc5be

#### 1. Complete List of All Cryptocurrency Tokens Held
Due to the focus on NFT transactions in the description, there are no specific ERC-20 tokens listed here. If balances were available, they would be included.

#### 2. Current USD Value of Each Token
Assuming minimal ETH holdings and primarily NFTs, the specific values would depend on current ETH and NFT market prices, which are not detailed in this dataset.

#### 3. Total Portfolio Value in USD
Without specific balances or token values provided, the total portfolio value cannot be calculated from this information.

#### 4. Percentage Distribution of Assets
Given the emphasis on NFTs in the wallet activities:
- **NFTs:** Estimated major portion based on transaction descriptions
- **ETH (if any):** Minimal

These sections would be filled with detailed numerical values based on a full extract of holdings, which is not provided in this case. If more specific wallet data were available, it could be used to determine exact holdings and values.
