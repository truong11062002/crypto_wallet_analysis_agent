# Analysis for 0xfe11490fcfd9940db0df0f1b3e6775669144f465

I see that you provided details about the wallet age and categorization but need an analysis of the cryptocurrency tokens held in this wallet. For a comprehensive wallet analysis, I can provide structured data if there is information on the specific tokens held, their current values, and the portfolio's total value. Here's an example format that we can use:

### Wallet Cryptocurrency Analysis

#### 1. Complete list of all cryptocurrency tokens held
- Example Token 1 (e.g., Ethereum, ETH)
- Example Token 2 (e.g., Bitcoin, BTC)

#### 2. Current USD value of each token
- Example Token 1: \$XX,XXX.XX
- Example Token 2: \$XX,XXX.XX

#### 3. Total portfolio value in USD
- \$XX,XXX.XX

#### 4. Percentage distribution of assets
- Example Token 1: XX.XX%
- Example Token 2: XX.XX%

Once you provide the cryptocurrency details of this wallet, I can format that information according to the structure above.
