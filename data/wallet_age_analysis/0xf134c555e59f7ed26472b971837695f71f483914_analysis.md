# Analysis for 0xf134c555e59f7ed26472b971837695f71f483914

To provide a cryptocurrency wallet analysis, I need access to wallet contents and their values rather than transaction history. It seems like the current data provided surrounds an analysis attempt focusing on transaction history rather than asset holdings. Thus, no token balances or portfolio value information is present.

If you provide the specific token balances and values for the wallet address 0xf134c555e59f7ed26472b971837695f71f483914, I can help by structuring the analysis according to your needs. Please include the following for the necessary calculations:

- List of all tokens with their quantities
- USD value per token
- Total USD portfolio value
- Any relevant fee or distribution details if available

Once I have the above information, I can format and analyze the wallet data.
