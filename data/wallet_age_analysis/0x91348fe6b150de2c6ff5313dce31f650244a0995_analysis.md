# Analysis for 0x91348fe6b150de2c6ff5313dce31f650244a0995

It seems there's a mix-up with your request. The provided information outlines the wallet activity of an NFT Collector/Trader, but it doesn't include specific cryptocurrency token balances, their USD values, or a total portfolio assessment. The analysis did not detail any traditional cryptocurrency holdings or investments beyond its NFT transactions.

To properly address your request regarding wallet analysis for cryptocurrency holdings, the following information would typically be needed:

1. **Complete list of all cryptocurrency tokens held**: 
   - Data on specific crypto assets in the wallet (e.g., ETH, USDT, etc.).

2. **Current USD value of each token**:
   - The monetary value for each token based on current market prices.

3. **Total portfolio value in USD**:
   - Sum of all token values in USD to reflect total holdings.

4. **Percentage distribution of assets**:
   - Calculation of how each token's value contributes to the total portfolio.

Without specific tokens and their USD values, this standard analysis cannot be performed. If available, kindly provide detailed token balance information for a comprehensive analysis. If the focus strictly remains on NFT activity and there's no cryptocurrency data to analyze, an NFT-centric approach and related insights would need to be derived separately.
