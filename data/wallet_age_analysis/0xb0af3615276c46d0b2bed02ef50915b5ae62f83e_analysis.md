# Analysis for 0xb0af3615276c46d0b2bed02ef50915b5ae62f83e

To provide an analysis of the wallet contents with current values and distribution, I would need specific data on the tokens held and their corresponding USD values. However, I can guide you through the data format and sections required for a typical cryptocurrency wallet analysis. When you have detailed token holdings and their values, you can fill it in as follows:

### 1. Complete List of All Cryptocurrency Tokens Held

- [Token Name 1] (e.g., Ethereum, USDC)
- [Token Name 2]
- [Token Name 3]
... etc.

### 2. Current USD Value of Each Token

- **[Token Name 1]:** $[Value] (e.g., Ethereum: $1,500.00)
- **[Token Name 2]:** $[Value]
- **[Token Name 3]:** $[Value]
... etc.

### 3. Total Portfolio Value in USD

- **Total Portfolio Value:** $[Total Value] (e.g., $10,000.00)

### 4. Percentage Distribution of Assets

- **[Token Name 1]:** [Percentage]% (e.g., Ethereum: 50%)
- **[Token Name 2]:** [Percentage]%
- **[Token Name 3]:** [Percentage]%
... etc.

Once the token data is available, arrange the entries in descending order of their USD values under each section. This will help in clearly understanding which token holds the maximum value in the portfolio and the corresponding distribution. Make sure to use appropriate symbols like $, % and format numbers to two decimal places for clarity.
